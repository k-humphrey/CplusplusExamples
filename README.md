# CplusplusExamples
This is a retro repo of my beginning C++ knowledge from a class called CSC 1300. I didn't even know what Github was when I was writing these! Other than being simple proof of my language knowledge, it's very cute to look at. I had so much fun learning C++ for the first time.

#edit: Added CSC1310 to show me learning data structures and algorithms in C++
Wow, I was in my data structures and algorithms class here. The professor at the time had us answer some simple reflection prompts with all of the programs. I'm leaving them in to remind myself of where I came from. College is just a hard transition, and that's okay! I've learned how to be more productive since, but I couldn't have done it if I gave up here.

#edit 2: notice: disclaimer and updates to come
I have been looking through the files and noticed that some files are missing their attributions entirely, or the attribution isn't full. Some of this code was written by the professor as an example or template code. I can't verify whether every single line is mine or the professor, simply because I can't remember. You'll just have to use your discretion. Most of the inclass practices are probably the teachers that I copy over to test and run myself. At just a glance, most of these programs have some errors with them, or really just aren't good implementations. So don't use this as a tutorial just yet. I hope I'll have some time to start revising these programs soon.
