# CplusplusExamples
This is a retro repo of my beginning C++ knowledge from a class called CSC 1300. I didn't even know what Github was when I was writing these! Other than being simple proof of my language knowledge, it's very cute to look at. I had so much fun learning C++ for the first time.

#edit: Added CSC1310 to show me learning data structures and algorithms in C++
Wow, I was in my data structures and algorithms class here. The professor at the time had us answer some simple reflection prompts with all of the programs. I'm leaving them in to remind myself of where I came from. College is just a hard transition, and that's okay! I've learned how to be more productive since, but I couldn't have done it if I gave up here.
